the “Top Things You Didn’t Know About…” Be sure to check back for more entries
soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>8. A light-emitting diode, or LED, is a type of solid-state
lighting that uses a semiconductor to convert electricity into light. Today’s
LED bulbs can be six-seven times more energy efficient than conventional
incandescent lights and cut energy use by more than 80 percent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>7. Good-quality LED bulbs can have a useful life of 25,000
hours or more -- meaning they can last more than 25 times longer than
traditional light bulbs. That is a life of more than three years if run 24
hours a day, seven days a week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>6. Unlike incandescent bulbs -- which release 90 percent of
their energy as heat -- LEDs use energy far more efficiently with little wasted
heat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>5. From traffic lights and vehicle brake lights to TVs and
display cases, LEDs are used in a wide range of applications because of their
unique characteristics, which include compact size, ease of maintenance,
resistance to breakage, and the ability to focus the light in a single
direction instead of having it go every which way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>4. LEDs contain no mercury, and a recent Energy Department
study determined that LEDs have a much smaller environmental impact than
incandescent bulbs. They also have an edge over compact fluorescent lights
(CFLs) that’s expected to grow over the next few years as LED technology
continues its steady improvement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>3. Since the Energy Department started funding solid-state
lighting R&amp;D in 2000, these projects have received 58 patents. Some of the
most successful projects include developing new ways to use materials, extract
more light, and solve the underlying technical challenges. Most recently, the
Energy Department announced five new projects that will focus on cutting costs
by improving manufacturing equipment and processes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>2. The first visible-spectrum LED was invented by Nick
Holonyak, Jr., while working for GE in 1962. Since then, the technology has
rapidly advanced and costs have dropped tremendously, making LEDs a viable
lighting solution. Between 2011 and 2012, global sales of LED replacement bulbs
increased by 22 percent while the cost of a 60-watt equivalent LED bulb fell by
nearly 40 percent. By 2030, it's estimated that LEDs will account for 75
percent of all lighting sales.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt;line-height:115%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN>1. In 2012, about 49 million LEDs were installed in the
U.S. and Canada -- saving about $675 million in annual energy costs. Switching
entirely to LED lights over the next two decades could save the U.S. $250
billion in energy costs, reduce electricity consumption for lighting by nearly
50 percent and avoid 1,800 million metric tons of carbon emissions.</span></p>
