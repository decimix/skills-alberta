SkillsCanada is an organization dedicated to promoting growth in the skilled trades and technology.
I competed at their provincial level competition in my final year of high school.

Thanks to the support and guidance of my Computer Science teacher, Mr. Couprie, and my passion for software development, I was awarded the gold medal
in Web Design and Development. This gave me the opportunity to represent Alberta at the national level competition.

Published here is a copy of my website. The entire site was developed in 12 hours with restricted Internet access.

## Project Summary
Students were required to create a website for a fictional small business.
The website was to be created using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.
